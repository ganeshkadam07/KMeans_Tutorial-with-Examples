<!-- # KMeans_Tutorial-with-Examples
K-means clustering is a popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm used for partitioning a dataset into groups or clusters based on their similarity. It aims to divide the data points into K distinct clusters, where each data point belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean (centroid). The K in K-means represents the number of clusters 
# k-Means Clustering for Mall Customers Data
This repository contains an implementation of k-Means Clustering for Mall Customers Data. The goal of this project is to segment customers based on their annual income and spending score using the k-means clustering algorithm.

Background
Understanding customer behavior is crucial for businesses, and customer segmentation is a powerful technique for market analysis. In this project, we leverage the k-means clustering algorithm to group mall customers into distinct segments based on their annual income and spending score. By identifying these segments, businesses can tailor their marketing strategies and personalize their offerings to different customer groups.

The k-means clustering algorithm is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm that partitions data into k clusters based on similarity. It is widely used in various domains for pattern recognition and data mining tasks.

Installation
To run this project locally, please follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

shell
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/ganeshkadam914/kmeans-mall-customers.git
Navigate to the project directory:


cd kmeans-mall-customers
Install the required dependencies. It is recommended to use a virtual environment (e.g., venv) to manage dependencies:

python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # Activate the virtual environment
pip install -r requirements.txt
Place your dataset file in the project directory. Make sure the file contains relevant data, such as customer IDs, annual income, and spending score.

Update the configuration parameters in the config.py file, such as the dataset file name, the number of clusters (k), and any other relevant settings.

Usage
To run the k-means clustering algorithm on the dataset, execute the following command:

python main.py
The script will read the dataset, perform the clustering, and generate the output clusters. The results will be saved in a file named output.csv.

Configuration
The configuration parameters can be modified in the config.py file. The following parameters are available:

dataset_file: The name of the dataset file (e.g., data.csv).
k: The number of clusters to generate.
max_iterations: The maximum number of iterations for the k-means algorithm.
random_state: The random seed for reproducibility.
Make sure to update these parameters according to your dataset and requirements.

Results
After running the script, the output clusters will be saved in the output.csv file. Each row represents a cluster, and the columns contain the customer IDs belonging to that cluster. You can analyze these clusters to gain insights into different customer segments based on their annual income and spending score.
